# Keylogger
# by eliasd

To compile the keylogger into an exe you need the module 'cx_Freeze' on windows 
which you can install via 'pip install cx_Freeze'.
the files 'keylogger.py' and 'keylogger_builder.py' must both be in the same directory.
Then just open the powershell and enter 'python keylogger_builder build'.

IMPORTANT: The path to the log must be adjusted in the keylogger.py file
